# fpDSP
Fixed point 16-bit Digital Signal Processing library for arduino, embedded and 8-bit systems. 

The PlusCLI project has some sample test commands to play with this.

## Inspirations
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CORDIC
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_angular_measurement

### Features/TODO
- [ ] Add Doxygen comments to header
- [ ] Split CORDIC in generic functions (rect2polar, polar2rec, rotateVector)
